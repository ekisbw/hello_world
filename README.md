# hello_world
beggining to use GitHub

This is my first true attempt to using GitHub. 
This will enable me to assist me in learning to code as I have been told
there are great resources available on this platform.

I have not in the past commit myself to learning programming but NOW I am more 
pressed to grow this skill to a level where I can apply the skill to building 
various projects. 

Yes I would like to earn a living from this skill but it will compliment the other skills.
